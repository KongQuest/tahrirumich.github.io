                        <p>ANN ARBOR— Today, the student body of Michigan has answered the call
                        of the Palestinian people to put our demands into action and joined the
                        Popular University for Gaza campaign organized by National Students for
                        Justice in Palestine (NSJP). As of the morning of April 22, students of
                        the TAHRIR Coalition have officially set up an encampment and occupied
                        the Diag on the University of Michigan's Ann Arbor campus. The beating
                        heart of our campus has been turned into a liberated zone of action in
                        solidarity with Gaza. We have one message for the architects of genocide
                        that “serve” as our administrators: your apathy towards justice will now
                        be broadcast to the world. Gone are the days where the regents get to
                        enjoy normal lives while they send dozens of police forces to brutalize
                        and arrest students peacefully protesting. Gone are the days where life
                        on this campus can go on uninterrupted as $6 billion of our endowment
                        funds the extermination of the Palestinian people. Gone are the days
                        where anyone in our community can turn a blind eye to Gaza and this
                        university’s complicity. We, the University of Michigan student body
                        firmly and proudly demand divestment now.</p>
                        <p>UMich commits over $6 billion to investment managers that have
                        profited from investments in "israeli" companies and/or military
                        contractors. The university has invested in, through fund managers in
                        venture capital and private equity, drone manufacturers like Skydio,
                        which has sent more than 100 drones to the Israeli military; military
                        contractors like Cobham and Ultra Electronics, which participate in the
                        construction of F-35 warplanes used to bombard Gazan civilians; Israeli
                        spyware firms like Oosto, which produce facial recognition software to
                        surveil Palestinians at checkpoints in the West Bank; and Israeli prison
                        surveillance company Attenti, which also contracts with the Michigan
                        Department of Corrections to create monitoring tools for those on
                        parole.</p>
                        <p>Our struggle is not ours alone. Inspired by the 100+ students facing
                        academic and carceral retaliation for protesting Columbia University's
                        investment in genocide, we along with Students for Justice in Palestine
                        chapters across the country have made the bold and unwavering decision
                        to occupy our campuses until our demands are met in full. No compromise
                        or unjust use of force levied against us will break our unwavering
                        commitment to Palestinian liberation and just resistance. We are not
                        leaving the Diag until we achieve full divestment.</p>
                        <p>Power to our freedom fighters, glory to our martyrs. All eyes on
                        Gaza, the Thawabit is our compass.</p>
