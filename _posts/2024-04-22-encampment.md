ANN ARBOR— Today, the student body of Michigan has answered the call
of the Palestinian people to put our demands into action and joined the
Popular University for Gaza campaign organized by National Students for
Justice in Palestine (NSJP). As of the morning of April 22, students of
the TAHRIR Coalition have officially set up an encampment and occupied
the Diag on the University of Michigan's Ann Arbor campus. The beating
heart of our campus has been turned into a liberated zone of action in
solidarity with Gaza. We have one message for the architects of genocide
that “serve” as our administrators: your apathy towards justice will now
be broadcast to the world. Gone are the days where the regents get to
enjoy normal lives while they send dozens of police forces to brutalize
and arrest students peacefully protesting. Gone are the days where life
on this campus can go on uninterrupted as $6 billion of our endowment
funds the extermination of the Palestinian people. Gone are the days
where anyone in our community can turn a blind eye to Gaza and this
university’s complicity. We, the University of Michigan student body
firmly and proudly demand divestment now.


UMich commits over $6 billion to investment managers that have
profited from investments in "israeli" companies and/or military
contractors. The university has invested in, through fund managers in
venture capital and private equity, drone manufacturers like Skydio,
which has sent more than 100 drones to the Israeli military; military
contractors like Cobham and Ultra Electronics, which participate in the
construction of F-35 warplanes used to bombard Gazan civilians; Israeli
spyware firms like Oosto, which produce facial recognition software to
surveil Palestinians at checkpoints in the West Bank; and Israeli prison
surveillance company Attenti, which also contracts with the Michigan
Department of Corrections to create monitoring tools for those on
parole.


Our struggle is not ours alone. Inspired by the 100+ students facing
academic and carceral retaliation for protesting Columbia University's
investment in genocide, we along with Students for Justice in Palestine
chapters across the country have made the bold and unwavering decision
to occupy our campuses until our demands are met in full. No compromise
or unjust use of force levied against us will break our unwavering
commitment to Palestinian liberation and just resistance. We are not
leaving the Diag until we achieve full divestment.


Power to our freedom fighters, glory to our martyrs. All eyes on
Gaza, the Thawabit is our compass.
