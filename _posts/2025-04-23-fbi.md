ANN ARBOR, MI - Early this morning around 8:00 am, FBI
agents, the Michigan State Police, and local police officers
in unmarked vehicles arrived at the homes of University of
Michigan pro-Palestine activists across Ann Arbor,
Ypsilanti, and Canton.

Law enforcement officers confiscated electronics,
questioned, and detained two activists, who were later
released from their Ann Arbor residence. Officers from the
Michigan Department of the Attorney General, the Plymouth
Police Department, and the FBI raided an Ypsilanti
residence, confiscating personal belongings, and detaining 4
individuals who were later released. The Canton Police
Department and the FBI raided an additional residence in
Canton, MI, detaining none.

At first, officers refused to present warrants at the
Ypsilanti raid. A communiqué from the City of Ypsilanti
reads, “the FBI informed Chief Anderson that all inquiries
regarding the execution of this warrant should be directed
to the Attorney General’s Office.”

ICE presence at the raids is unconfirmed as of yet.
