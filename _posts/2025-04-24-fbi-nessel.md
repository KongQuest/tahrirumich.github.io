**APRIL 23, ANN ARBOR, MI** - Between 6:00 am to 9:00 am on
Wednesday, April 23rd, FBI agents, the Michigan State
Police, and local police officers, at the behest of Attorney
General Dana Nessel, arrived in unmarked vehicles at the
homes of University of Michigan pro-Palestine activists
across residences in Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti, and Canton.

The FBI and Ann Arbor Police Department officers confiscated
electronics and questioned and detained two individuals, who
were later released from their Ann Arbor residence. Officers
from the Michigan State Police, the FBI, and the Plymouth
Police Department raided an Ypsilanti residence,
confiscating personal belongings and detaining three
individuals, who were later released. The Canton Police
Department, Michigan State Police, University of Michigan
Police Department, and FBI raided another residence in
Canton, MI, confiscating electronics and belongings,
detaining and releasing four residents.

After stalling when asked to produce warrants during the
Ypsilanti raid, local and federal officers presented unusual
warrants from the Office of the Attorney General that did
not identify probable cause for any alleged crime. When
Ypsilanti city officials asked questions, the FBI refused to
answer them, instead referring them to Dana Nessel's office.
When contacted by the press, Nessel later claimed to be
investigating "multi-jurisdictional" vandalism, although no
actual instances of vandalism were cited nor were any
jurisdictions named.

"Dana Nessel

as a democratic bulwark against the Trump Administration,
yet has demonstrated continuous collaboration with Trump's
federal government to repress the popular movement for
Palestinian liberation. Nessel's irresponsible conduct has
already endangered Michigan residents, putting them in the
crosshairs of the Trump Administration's anti-immigrant and
anti-democratic assaults. On April 6 at the Detroit airport,
federal agents questioned and harassed

an Arab-American NLG lawyer representing one of the U-M
Encampment 11. This joint escalation by Nessel, the FBI,
State and local police is a clear attempt to intimidate
protestors and attack their constitutional right to freedom
of speech," said Liz Jacob, attorney at the Sugar Law Center
for Economic and Social Justice.

These raids represent the latest in an alarming series of
escalations, spanning more than a year of repression against
pro-Palestine activists and their allies at the U-M, and
increasingly across the

Since November 17th, 2023, over 56 pro Palestinian activists
have been arrested at the behest of the U-M Board of
Regents, for protesting the

pro-Palestine protesters at the behest of U-M Regents, many
of whom are financial contributors to her political

facilitating the Trump administration's escalating attacks
on higher education. We condemn the U-M Regents' and Dana
Nessel's attack on the movement for divestment from
"israel," deliberately furthering the Trump administration's
assault on higher education. We call on all those who stand
for justice to speak out against state repression of
solidarity with Palestine. Divest now!
