On Monday April 15, there will be <a href="https://strike4gaza.org/">a nationwide strike for Gaza</a>, called for by 23+ national Palestinian and Muslim organizations. The goals are to disrupt business as usual, put pressure on the economy, and mobilize people to participate in local action and join the movement to end the genocide. This Tax Day, as the U.S. pours taxpayer dollars towards weaponry for Zionist genocide, students, consumers and workers will respond by taking action in support of Palestinian liberation.


<p>TAHRIR is organizing a one-day strike at UM in recognition of this national call. We know that, as the U.S. government funds this genocide, <a href="https://bit.ly/UMEndowmentGuide">so too does the University of Michigan</a>. We recognize this, just as we urge all undergraduates, graduate students, faculty, and staff to withhold their labor from their classrooms, labs and offices, choosing instead to participate in actions that advance liberation for Palestine. </p>
