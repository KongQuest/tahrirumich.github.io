Regent Hubbard portrays herself as the voice of the moderate
conservative on the Board and the protector of free speech;
this entails being a shrill for genocide on the Board,
associating herself with corrupt GOP insiders, and raking in
cash from weapons manufacturers that power the genocide.

## Background and workÂ 

Hubbard's career as a conservative lobbyist and consultant
stems from her father's involvement in local conservative
politics as a Branch County Commissioner. Hubbard's personal
career in this field launched after she graduated from
University of Michigan. After graduation, she worked as a
legislative staffer for multiple Michigan Republicans
including Nick Smith, Willis C. Bullard Jr., and Bill
Martin. Hubbard, a proponent of big business, transitioned
to lobbying by working for the Detroit Regional Chamber
(DRC), where she represented over 20,000 clients for 17
years. The DRC is a business lobbying group, representing
companies such as Amazon and Blue Cross Blue Shield. Members
of the Chamber visited
[israel in 2017](https://web.archive.org/web/20210516002502/https://www.detroitchamber.com/michigan-business-delegation-explores-israeli-startup-ecosystem-cybersecurity-innovation/)
to build relations with the Occupation, and the Chamber was
the main supporter and creator of the Michigan-Israel
Business Accelerator.

She then joined
[Acuitas](https://acuitasllc.com/team_member/sarah-hubbard/)
LLC, a lobbying firm, where she is currently a
[co-owner](https://www.crainsdetroit.com/awards/sarah-hubbard-2020-50-names-know-lobbying)
and their Principal. Acuitas has a close relationship and
often collaborates with the DRC. Acuitas LLC has a history
of
[lobbying](https://www.followthemoney.org/entity-details?eid=106284)
onbehalf of big business (Amazon), tobacco companies
(Lorillard Incorporated), and big pharma (including Blue
Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, Trinity Health) and many
more.

## Insider networks, donors, and allegiances

Like many of the Regents, Hubbard is a political insider
that succeeded in her campaign to become Regent by
befriending other elites. As a result, Hubbard operates with
corrupt officials and genocidal donors, carrying these
conflicts of interests into her position as Regent. Along
with Hubbard's own ideological justification for her support
of Israel, the connections and background of her campaign
contributors demonstrate the clear financial incentives for
her continued support of the Occupation.

Hubbard is closely tied to Heather Lombardini, a disgraced
campaign strategist that serves as
[treasurer](https://cfrsearch.nictusa.com/documents/565170/details/filing/cover?changes=0)
for Hubbard's campaign for her position as Regent and
founder of Bright Spark Strategies, a consulting firm
Hubbard hired for her campaign. Lombardini
[collaborated](https://archive.is/VxozZ) with Sandra Baxter,
another lobbyist, to funnel money into Republican Senate
Majority Leader Mike Shirkey's Unlock Michigan ballot
initiative, through Michigan Citizens for Fiscal
Responsibility, of which she was President, and Michigan! My
Michigan!, of which she was treasurer. Lombardini was
[charged](https://www.michigan.gov/ag/-/media/Project/Websites/AG/releases/2024/February/Lombardini-Complaint.pdf)
by Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel in the summer of
2024, and faces several thousand dollars in fines and up to
14 years in prison for submitting an affidavit with lies
around campaign finance.

Hubbard isn't directly implicated in Lombardini's alleged
acts of campaign finance fraud, but her close relationship
invites further investigation and a wary eye over Hubbard's
own finances. More importantly and more generally, Hubbard's
relationship with Lombardini is reflective of Hubbard's
general position as a political insider, with allegiances to
politicians, lobbyists, and donors that she serves as
Regent. After Hubbard was elected as Regent, Acuitas LLC's
client Bizfleets signed
[contracts](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bizfleets_bizfleets-is-honored-to-be-partnered-with-activity-7128760217919508481-3MHw?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
in 2023 to provide electric vehicles for the University's
[fleet](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bizfleets_goblue-activity-7151629712073629698-wRUR?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
(vehicles). Tim Easterwood, Bizfleets' owner, had
contributed \$11,000 to her campaign.
[Radial Power](https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/509221-09/company/deals#deal-241863-76T)
recently won the bid to install solar panels at the Ann
Arbor campus. Radial Power is a subsidiary of EnergyRE,
which is the parent company of
[Southern Current LLC](https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/495467-65/investor/profile#executives),
another client of Hubbard and Acuitas LLC.

These donors are often prominent supporters of the Zionist
entity. Jonathan Kellner and his partner Ana-Marie
Wheatcroft have donated \$18,500 to Hubbard's campaign over
the past four years. Kellner is the
[CEO](https://www.sifma.org/people/jonathan-kellner/) of
MEMX, the stock exchange that is favored by war profiteers
such as Citadel and BlackRock. Kellner

Finvarb's
[son,](https://worldredeye.com/2018/01/residence-inn-miami-sunny-isles-beach-grand-opening-celebration/)
Jack Finvarb, just graduated from the University of
Michigan, where he was the Director of Community Affairs of
the [TAMID group](https://www.michigantamid.org/), a student
club at the Ross Business school that seeks to strengthen
relationships with israeli companies through fellowships and
travel to israel. This group not only consults and
[invests](https://www.michigantamid.org/_files/ugd/31851e_e83f6b5ade644ef4a0fea11c9f36b640.pdf)
in companies, but teaches those involved how to
[engage in the israeli market](https://www.michigantamid.org/_files/ugd/31851e_e83f6b5ade644ef4a0fea11c9f36b640.pdf),
which helps fund the genocide in Palestine.

The most incriminating of Hubbard's ties to Zionist donors
come from the Kouza family, the second largest donor to her
campaign and the owner of weapons firm EOTech. EOTech was
bought out by KouCar Management, the Kouza family's
corporation, in 2021. KouCar Management has a vast
[portfolio](https://koucar.com/companies/) of real estate,
hotels, and war profiteering. Not only are their products
sold in the apartheid state, but the IOF acquires these
products through U.S. aid and U.S. weapons and aircraft
sales. EOTech supplies holographic weapon sights,
holographic head up displays, night vision goggles,
binoculars, and helmets to the U.S. and foreign militaries,
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), law enforcement
agencies, and many more. On the ground, night vision goggles
and rifle scopes are used by many military ground troops,
including the IOF, due to U.S. weapon sales. In the air,
EOTech assists in genocide by working with Northrop Grumman
and Lockheed Martin, the U.S.'s top defense contractors.
[Northrop Grumman subcontracts EOTECH](https://www.highergov.com/contract/?searchID=-ANdTN0VLWB_1cvojDiQD#subcontract)
to manufacture sensors and electronic hardware that are used
in their
[LITENING pods](https://www.northropgrumman.com/what-we-do/air/litening-advanced-targeting-pod).
These LITENING pods are used for target acquisition in
multiple fighter jets (F-15 and F-16), bombers (B-52), and
additional military aircraft including the MQ-9 Reaper and
C-130. **F-15, F-16, and C-130's are all extensively used by
the israeli Air Force with this technology to bomb
indiscriminately.** Additional development of at least 50
F-15 fighter jets were commissioned in the

are and have been used to commit genocide against

## Standing against human rights as Regent

Hubbard has stood with her Zionist donors and fellow party
insiders since her election to the Board of Regents in 2020.

In Summer 2023, during the Graduate Employees Organization
(GEO) Strike, Hubbard
[claimed](https://www.michigandaily.com/news/administration/regent-sarah-hubbard-talks-goals-and-concerns-as-new-board-chair/)
that the University was open to having conversations with
GEO at the bargaining table, but that GEO "have been a
little less active in those discussions." She also stated
that "the GSIs learned in the Spring that when they don't
work they don't get paid," seemingly a diss at GSIs who
chose to strike for their rights as university workers to
fair pay and good workplace conditions.

Even more so than the other chronically online Regent,
Jordan Acker, Hubbard loves using her Twitter profile
(@RegentHubbard) to condescendingly mock students and ensure
her personal political goals can be enacted as University
policy \-- a marked contradiction to her recent push for the
University to embrace \"institutional neutrality.\" She took
to Twitter after the March 2024 Regents' meeting, and
numerous times over the next several months, to state that
the endowment is \"shielded from political pressures,\"
arguing that funding the genocide is not political but that
divesting from the genocide would be political.

Among the Tweets she has engaged with:

- A Like to a reply from @xxxayc18: \"Thank you
  :prayer-hands: Wish that everyone was as brave as you.
  Stay safe against the terror supporters on your campus\"
- A Like to SilverPatriot: \"Telling these communist punks
  and foreign operatives to take a flying leap is the
  correct way to deal with this.\"
- A Like to a reply from SteveDaily33: \"She has a much more
  kinder way of saying \'go fuck yourselves\' than me\"
- A retweet of Bill Maher's
  [monologue](https://x.com/billmaher/status/1844938477512675654)
  to Chappell Roan, claiming that she would be "thrown off
  of a roof" in Gaza for being gay. As many responses noted,
  no evidence exists for gay people ever being thrown off of
  roofs in Palestine, though many
  [have been executed](https://x.com/MargBarAmerica/status/1845216563210715327)
  by the IDF by being thrown off of roofs.

We can\'t tell if Hubbard is still sending Likes to Tweets
these days calling activists terror supporters, telling
students they should commit suicide, or telling TAHRIR to
\"go fuck yourselves.\" But our guess is that she still is,
now that Likes are hidden on Twitter and she can Like away
without consequence.

Hubbard takes her views to media outside of Twitter as well,
in some cases supporting anti-Semitic, racist, and
Islamophobic rhetoric, despite claiming to care about the
safety of Jewish students. After the TAHRIR encampment on
University of Michigan's campus was violently raided by
UMPD, Hubbard spoke on
[Jason Barclay's radio hour](https://spreaker.com/episode/university-of-michigan-police-dismantle-pro-hamas-encampment-w-um-regent-board-chair-sarah-hubbard-5-22-24--60132818).
Jason Barclay is a raging
[antisemite and racist](https://x.com/MrJustinBarclay).

Hubbard's latest campaign has been to push the University of
Michigan to adopt a policy of "institutional neutrality," a
policy passed at the October 2024 meeting of the Board of
Regents after the publication of a report written by
Advisory Committee on the University of Michigan Principles
on Diversity of Thought and Freedom of Expression. The
amendment declared that the University would adopt a "heavy
presumption against institutional statements on political
and social issues that are not directly connected to
internal university functions." The irony should not be lost
on readers that the institution has been far from neutral,
or that the genocide in Palestine that forms the subtext of
his report is separate from the university's internal
functions given the university's profound violence exercised
against antiwar activists this past year. Hubbard advocates
for neutrality as she amplifies calls for violence against
protesters with her handle \@RegentHubbard on Twitter, and
advocates for getting rid of DEI through the same platform
and at the Board of Regents' meetings. Hubbard's advocacy
for the policy of institutional neutrality emerged through
her alignment with the American Council of Trustees and
Alumni (ACTA), which has not only advocated for
institutional neutrality but also the suspension of Students
for Justice in Palestine chapters.

Several of the Regents actively market themselves as
progressive. Brown and Ilitch want to be the workers'
Regents; Ilitch markets herself as a first-generation
student. Acker sees himself as the "nice guy" Regent,
"progressive" and open to community dialogue. But Hubbard
operates with no such pretense, amplifying calls for
students to commit suicide or calling them terror
supporters, mocking them through her social media and during
Regents' meetings, taking money from weapons manufacturers
and funneling contracts to her allies. Hubbard's outright
conservatism and bloodthirst is only possible because of the
Zionist support of the Board of Regents as a whole, and
because conservative and "progressive" Regents alike share a
common interest of defending capital. As activists affected
by the violence committed by the University of Michigan, we
reject the fascist violence enabled by both Hubbard and the
"progressive" Regents. We will call out their hypocrisy and
their fabricated divisions among party lines until the Board
serves the constituency that elected it.
