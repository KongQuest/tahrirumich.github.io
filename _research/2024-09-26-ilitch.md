Denise Ilitch, like most of the Regents, comes from money --- but
Ilitch's family has a specific and long-running history of dispossession
and false promises made to Detroit. Their fortune is primarily managed
through Ilitch Holdings, a corporation managing many different entities
including:

- Little Caesars Pizza, the Ilitch family's largest business
- The National Hockey League (NHL) Detroit Red Wings
- The Major League Baseball (MLB) Detroit Tigers
- Olympia Entertainment
- Olympia Development
- Olympia Parking
- Blue Line Foodservice Distribution
- Champion Foods
- 313 Presents
- the Little Caesars Pizza Kit Fundraising Program
- Hockeytown Cafe, and a variety of venues within these entities.

Ilitch Holdings subsidiaries manage

- Detroit\'s Fox Theatre
- City Theatre
- Pine Knob Music Theatre
- Michigan Lottery Amphitheater
- Meadow Brook Amphitheater
- Little Caesars Arena, which replaced Joe Louis Arena after closing
  in July 2017

Ilitch grew up in Michigan, graduating from University of Michigan (UM)
in 1977 and the University of Detroit Law School in 1980. After law
school, Ilitch joined the family business, serving as vice president of
Little Caesar Enterprises from 1981 to 1992. In 2000, her parents
appointed her and her brother, Christopher Ilitch, co-presidents of
Ilitch Holdings. She left this position in 2004 after becoming
[estranged from her mother and
brother](https://www.freep.com/story/money/business/michigan/2016/05/05/christopher-ilitch-ilitch-holdings-mike-marian-little-caesars/83992742/).
Illitch became a regent of the University of Michigan in 2008, a
position which she has held for over 16 years.

Ilitch Holdings' most controversial projects have operated through
Olympia Development, a real estate and construction company that has
received hundreds of millions of dollars in tax subsidies with little to
show for it. The single largest project from Olympia Development, which
kickstarted its broader campaign of development, and which Olympia is
still struggling to "catch up" to, is Little Caesars Arena (LCA), which
was built to house the Ilitch-owned Detroit Red Wings and later also the
Detroit Pistons.

Little Caesars Arena opened in 2017, with construction costing a total
of [\$862
million](https://web.archive.org/web/20201130182748/https://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20170523/news/629041/latest-little-caesars-arena-construction-cost-8629-million).
It was --- and still is --- an immensely controversial project. LCA
faced lawsuits over funding from property taxes [previously designated
for
schools](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/2017/09/28/farren-philpot-detroit-schools-funding-arena/106096776/)
[without a vote from
Detroiters,](https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2017/06/01/lawsuit-seeks-voter-approval-little-caesars-arena-public-funding/362816001/)
\$34.5 million of which was attacked in the suit as relevant to the
Pistons' move to the arena but which received a total of \$363 million
in public funding. A judge threw out the lawsuit for its failure to
demonstrate injury, though the harms are quite clear. A [separate,
successful,
suit](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/detroit-city/2017/08/23/little-caesars-arena-construction-fines/104902524/)
accused LCA of failing to hire a worker base comprising 51% of
Detroiters, winning \$2.9 million across 53 contractors (though this was
barely a slap on the wrist for most contractors; John Papalas & Co was
fined literally 26 cents). Later, a [Black worker
sued](https://www.michiganpublic.org/law/2018-02-17/detroit-man-sues-little-caesars-arena-construction-firm-alleges-mississippi-style-racism)
for "Mississippi-style discrimination," including bullying and an unjust
layoff from Hardman Construction which is one of the dozens of LCA's
construction contractors. A settlement was reached in Wilson v. Hardman
Construction case in December of 2018. Most recently, workers in LCA
through SEIU Local 1 [brought signatures to City
Hall](https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/local/2023/02/07/little-caesars-arena-workers-demand-action-at-city-hall-in-downtown-detroit/)
in February 2023 for a labor relations board to oversee grievances and
issue guidelines for wages, [a resistance to the precarious and
low-paying
jobs](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/columnists/labor-voices/2023/06/20/labor-voices-tax-backed-arenas-should-benefit-workers/70337129007/)
created through the LCA project. While Ilitch takes advantage of the
Detroit community, she has served as the board of directors for the
Detroit Branch of the NAACP and the ACLU. She embodies hypocrisy while
actively harming the community she claims to serve.

As part of the plan for the LCA, the Ilitches promised the development
of five neighborhoods, complete with mixed-use housing, shopping
centers, and new parking, called "The District Detroit". But those
highly-valued promises [never
materialized.](https://www.freep.com/story/opinion/editorials/2023/03/17/ilitch-arena-little-caesars-district-detroit-abatements/69986713007/)
This did not stop the Ilitches from continuing and expanding this
promise after the LCA was constructed, though, acquiring last year
[nearly \$800
million](https://www.freep.com/story/money/business/2023/04/25/district-detroit-brownfield-plan-approval/70147850007/)
in state tax subsidies and [\$51.8
million](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/detroit-city/2023/05/30/downtown-detroit-city-council-billionaire-real-estate-developer-stephen-ross-ilitch-fox-theatre/70268184007/)
from the City for the \$1.5 billion-dollar District Detroit project. But
after ten years these bold visions have accrued nothing but [blighted
buildings](https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2018/05/23/blight-tickets-ilitch-cass-avenue-detroit/623246002/)
and tax subsidies.

Now the Ilitches are promising another expansion to The District: the
University of Michigan Center for Innovation (UMCI), a major
collaboration between Olympia Development and UM alum and megadonor
Stephen Ross of Related Companies, who the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project
[profiled](https://worstevictorsbayarea.org/list/#stephen-m.-ross) in
2023 as one of the "Worst Evictors of the Bay Area." Like previous
District Detroit initiatives, promises are large and public money is at
stake. Olympia owned a plot of land at Grand River Avenue and West
Columbia street that was
[donated](https://detroit.umich.edu/news-stories/umci-design-approved-construction-ramps-up/)
to the University of Michigan in 2022, and is the planned site for the
UMCI. The project has received \$100 million from the State of Michigan,
\$50 million from anonymous donors, and a \$100 million gift from
codeveloper Stephen Ross, who stands to benefit from his company's
involvement in the project. Will the UMCI be anything more than a money
laundering scheme for Ross and Related Companies, facilitated by Ilitch
Holding's Olympia Development? The history of dispossession led by
Olympia Development suggests that it will not.

The self-dealing doesn't end with Stephen Ross; in 2022, Olympia
Development bought several plots of land adjacent to Comerica Park, the
Wayne County-owned stadium that serves as the home of the Ilitch-owned
Tigers. In 2023, [Axios revealed](http://this/) that the profits from
the sale would go right back to financing renovations for Comerica Park
--- which the Ilitches benefit from as the owners of the Tigers. The
Ilitches pay for something once, then make a backdoor deal to get
something for free in response.

What is Denise Ilitch's role in all of this? Ilitch has made attempts to
distance herself from her family's empire, especially when the
University is involved. In 2021, Denise Ilitch made a [disgruntled
public
statement](https://www.freep.com/story/news/education/2021/07/16/denise-ilitch-michigan-center-innovation-stephen-ross/7995352002/)
expressing "complete surprise" when it was revealed that Ilitch Holdings
was participating in creating the Center for Innovation with Related and
Stephen Ross, and recused herself from her Regents duties around the
deal. Then-President Schlissel's backdoor handling of negotiations with
Related and Ross would be [one tension point of
many](https://www.freep.com/story/news/education/2021/09/17/university-michigan-board-of-regents-mark-schlissel/8271355002/)
between the Regents and Schlissel.

Though she no longer has a formal position in her family's companies,
her political influence and persona as a leading Detroit businesswoman
is only possible because of her continued association with the Little
Caesars dynasty, necessitating recusals like the kind she gave in 2021.
Ilitch regularly makes [podcast appearances
](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/denise-ilitch-an-integral-part-of-detroits/id1486892616?i=1000504350958)where
she boasts of her family's history of business in Detroit and her own
role in coordinating their takeover of downtown Detroit. Her election
and re-election campaigns were funded by several executives of Ilitch
Holdings, including David Agius, Scott Fisher, Charles Jones, Ken
Holland, and Michael Healy.Â  Ilitch [cites her experience "help\[ing\]
start her family's business"](https://www.ilitchforregent.com/) as
valuable expertise in her current campaign material.

## Electoral Troubles

Denise Ilitch is currently the only incumbent Regent at the University
of Michigan running for re-election; Ilitch and Ron Weiser are eligible
for re-election, but Weiser failed to receive his party's nomination at
the GOP Michigan Convention this summer. The campaign of
Palestinian-American civil and human rights lawyer Huwaida Arraf [has
filed a lawsuit](https://www.huwaida4umich.com/pressrelease) to contest
the Michigan Democratic Party's nomination of Ilitch and fellow regent
candidate Shauna Ryder Diggs. The suit alleges that the Party [broke
their own proportional voting
rules](https://thedemocratist.substack.com/p/mdp-botches-u-of-m-regent-nominations),
costing Huwaida the nomination, and that the election lacked
transparency, with Huwaida's campaign being denied access to the Party's
tabulation area while other candidates, even Regent Paul Brown, were
allowed to be present. The reason Denise Ilitch received this nomination
seems clear: the Democratic Party would prefer a regent who will listen
to big business over one who will listen to students.

Denise Ilitch's campaign today tries to erase her billionaire heritage,
instead sending texts to all Michigan Democratic Party members that cast
her as a "first-generation" student. We know better --- Ilitch coasts
on the economic and social capital commanded by Ilitch Holdings, today
navigating the world of Michigan elites and steadily rotating through
board positions, podcasts, and TV appearances.
