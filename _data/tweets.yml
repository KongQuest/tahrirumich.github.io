      - "Told by the UM Regents to prosecute, Dana Nessel is now doing their dirty work—criminalizing dissent instead of upholding civil rights. This isn’t about justice, it’s about control and protecting investments in genocide."
      - "Dana Nessel doesn’t care about civil rights—she’s carrying out the UM Regents’ dirty work, prosecuting activists to protect the powerful. She’s a disgrace to the very principles she claims to uphold."
      - "When Dana Nessel targets activists for expressing dissent, isn't she adopting the very tactics she claims to oppose? We need leaders who uphold democratic principles, not undermine them."
      - "Dana Nessel is bending the law to serve the Regents and protect Zionist's investments. We will NOT be intimidated. Palestine will be free, and history will remember the cowards."

  - category: for her hypocrisy with regards to LGBTQ rights and liberation
    content:
      - "Dana Nessel claims to be an ally for the LGBTQ+ community - now she actively attacks queer activists. Dana Nessel you could not be openly gay if it were not for queer activists. The hypocrisy is glaring."
      - "Dana Nessel’s hypocrisy is glaring—she’s a queer woman attacking queer activists for standing up for Palestine. She’s betraying her own community for political gain."
      - "The Stonewall Riots were a rebellion for queer liberation, yet Dana Nessel—who benefits from that activism—is now prosecuting queer activists. This is not only hypocrisy, it’s a betrayal of everything the LGBTQ+ community fought for."

  - category: for her complicity with the genocide in Gaza
    content:
      - "When Dana Nessel prosecutes pro-Palestine activists, she’s doing Israel’s bidding, not fighting for justice. She’s a tool of state repression and genocide."
      - "Children are tried, or held without trial, in Israeli military judiciary systems. Their numbers have increased to 500 since October 7, held for crimes such as 'throwing stones.' Free them all! All the prison walls must fall!"
      - "Dana Nessel is nothing more than a pawn for Israel, using the courts to crush dissent and protect Israel and UMich's investments in genocide. She’s not a prosecutor—she’s a mouthpiece for oppression."
      - "While Western media has turned away from atrocities Israel continues to commit - hundreds of people killed since the ceasefire began, hundreds still kept as political prisoners to punish dissent - we continue to fight those who enabled genocide. Dana Nessel, UM Regents - we will not forget."
      - "Israel took the opportunity of the genocide enabled by the US to take thousands more political prisoners. Despite their best attempts, Israel did not manage to keep all of them - hundreds are being returned although thousands more men, women, and children remain in atrocious conditions. In Amerikkka, prisoners are enslaved for labor for corporations or left without protection from fire, weather, and disease. And political prosecutions have been used across the world to silence dissent. All the prison walls must fall!"
      - "Dana Nessel is a bought-and-paid-for agent of the Israeli state, using the legal system as a weapon to destroy anyone who challenges their agenda. This is political warfare, not justice."
      - "Dana Nessel’s prosecution isn’t about weighing evidence—it’s about putting Palestine on trial. Silencing voices calling out Israeli oppression is an attack on the Palestinian resistance."
      - "Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed since the ceasefire began this year - Dana Nessel hopes everyone will forget about her enabling of genocide and let her get on with politically punishing these young people. Palestine won. Palestine will be free!"
      - "By prosecuting pro-Palestine activists, Dana Nessel is putting the entire Palestinian struggle on trial. This isn’t about law—it’s about suppressing the truth and being an agent of genocide."
      - "By targeting activists who speak out for Palestine, Dana Nessel is putting the fight for Palestinian liberation on trial. This isn’t about the law, it’s about suppressing calls for justice."
      - "Dana Nessel is enabling genocide by targeting activists who expose Israel’s crimes. She’s not a prosecutor—she’s an enabler of atrocities. #StopTheGenocide #DropTheCharges"
      - "When Dana Nessel targets activists fighting for Palestine, she’s fueling the genocide of Palestinians. Her actions are not just a betrayal of justice—they’re a betrayal of humanity. #StopTheGenocide #StandWithActivists"
      - "Dana Nessel is an agent of oppression, using her power to shield Israel’s genocide of Palestinians. She’s not a public servant—she’s a tool of state violence. #ComplicitInGenocide #DropTheCharges"

  - category: for prosecuting protesters instead of fighting against Trump
    content:
      - "Dana Nessel keeps touting her 'legal cases' against Trump's fascist policies - but she herself is at the forefront of fascist repression of protest. You can't have it both ways, Dana!"
      - "Dana Nessel will never be able to handle political office again - too many people have seen through her facade. Democrats, her own party, have booed her across the state for this political repression and they will never forget!"
      - "Dana Nessel touts her 'defender of rights' and 'anti-Trump' image, but when pro-Palestine voices speak out, she uses the law as a weapon. Why is she using the same tactics as Trump?"
      - "Dana Nessel’s anti-Trump act is a joke. She’s no better than him, using the state to silence opposition and crush activists. She’s the same kind of authoritarian—just with a liberal mask. #FascistLikeTrump #DanasLikeDonald"
      - "Dana Nessel claims to oppose Trump’s fascism, yet she’s using the state to silence activists and dissent. This isn’t anti-Trump—it’s fascism in a different form. She’s a fascist in progressive clothing."
      - "Dana Nessel started doing Trump's work for him before he even asked her to - punishing activists via the criminalizing system for opposing a genocide."
      - "Dana Nessel wants to act like the anti-Trump hero, but she’s nothing more than a fascist in disguise. Prosecuting activists for speaking out? That’s Trumpian authoritarianism."
      - "Dana Nessel, our 'Democratic' Attorney General, sided with Genocide Joe and the Zionists - and they all lost in the face of Palestinian strength and revolutionary power. Now as Trump continues to raise tensions and call for Palestinian genocide and expulsion, she's backing him too. They will all lose again and again."
